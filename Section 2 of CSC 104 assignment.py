#1.	Write a short Python code to display the name of your name & department
print("Name : Abba \nDepartment : Computer Science")

#2.	Assign the string "Boo!" to the variable scare and print the variable.
scare = "Boo!"
print(scare)


#3.	Add two variables and assign the result to a third variable. print all the variable names.
variable1 = 5
variable2 = 7
variable3 = variable1 + variable2
print("Var 1 : ", variable1, "\nVar 2 : ", variable2, "\n", variable3)


#4.	Divide 12 by the decimal .5 and assign the result to the variable outcome and print the variable
x = 12
z = 0.5
b = x / z
print(b)


#5.	Assign the sum of two numbers to a variable and print the variable.
e = 8
t = 9
g = e + t
print(g)


#6.	Write the code that finds the remainder when 8 is divided by 3
e = 8
t = 9
g = e + t
print(g)


#7.	Rewrite the following statement to force this order: First, multiply 2 by 4. Then add 4 and 2. Then multiply the first result by the second result. Print the result.
x = 2 * 4 * 4 + 2
a = 2
b = 4
c = a * b
d = b + a
e = c * d
print(e)
